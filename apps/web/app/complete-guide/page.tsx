          <GuideSection id="workflow" number="1" title="The Complete Workflow">
            <P highlight>This is the end-to-end methodology for creating software with frontier AI models, exhaustive markdown planning, beads-based task management, and coordinated agent swarms. Every project follows the same arc, whether it is a small CLI tool or a complex web application. This guide is about moving the hardest thinking into representations that still fit into model context windows. That is the whole game.</P>

            <FlywheelDiagram />

            <P>It starts with you. You have an idea for a piece of software. Maybe a web app, maybe a CLI tool, maybe a complex system. Instead of opening an editor and starting to code, you do something that feels counterintuitive: you spend the vast majority of your time planning.</P>

            <NumberedList items={[
              <><strong>You explain what you want to build</strong> to a frontier model like GPT Pro with Extended Reasoning. Your concept, your goals, the user workflows, why it matters. The model produces an initial markdown plan: a comprehensive design document for the entire system.</>,
              <><strong>You ask competing models to create their own plans.</strong> Claude Opus, Gemini with Deep Think, Grok Heavy. Each one independently designs the same project. They come up with surprisingly different approaches, each with unique strengths and blind spots.</>,
              <><strong>You synthesize the best ideas from all plans into one.</strong> GPT Pro analyzes the competing plans and produces a &quot;best of all worlds&quot; hybrid that blends the strongest ideas from every model into a single superior document.</>,
              <><strong>You iterate relentlessly.</strong> Round after round of refinement, each time in a fresh conversation, until the suggestions become incremental. Plans created this way routinely reach 3,000 to 6,000+ lines. They are not slop. They are the result of countless iterations and feedback from many frontier models.</>,
              <><strong>You convert the plan into beads.</strong> Beads are self-contained work units (like Jira or Linear tasks, but optimized for use by coding agents). Each bead carries its own context, reasoning, dependencies, and test obligations. A complex plan might produce 200-500 beads with a full dependency graph.</>,
              <><strong>You polish the beads obsessively.</strong> &quot;Check your beads N times, implement once,&quot; where N is as many as you can stomach. Each polishing round finds things the previous round missed: duplicates, missing dependencies, incomplete context. You run this 4-6+ times until convergence.</>,
              <><strong>You launch a swarm of agents.</strong> Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini-CLI sessions running in parallel, all in the same codebase. They coordinate through Agent Mail, choose work intelligently using bv&apos;s graph-theory routing, and execute beads systematically.</>,
              <><strong>You tend the swarm, not the code.</strong> The human checks for stuck beads, rescues agents after context compaction, sends review prompts, and ensures flow quality. You are the clockwork deity. You designed the machine, set it running, and now you manage it.</>,
              <><strong>Agents review, test, and harden.</strong> Self-review with fresh eyes, cross-agent review, random code exploration, testing coverage, UI/UX polish. Rounds and rounds until reviews come back clean.</>,
            ]} />

            <P>That is the whole movie. For the CASS Memory System, this process turned a 5,500-line markdown plan into 347 beads. Twenty-five agents produced 11,000 lines of working, tested code with 204 commits in about five hours.

            <BlockQuote>Once you have the beads in good shape based on a great markdown plan, I almost view the project as a foregone conclusion at that point. The rest is basically mindless &quot;machine tending&quot; of your swarm of 5-15 agents.</BlockQuote>

            <P>The frontier models and coding agent harnesses really are that good already. They just need this extra level of tooling, prompting, and workflows to reach their full potential. The rest of this guide zooms into each stage.</P>

          {/* ============================================================= */}
          <GuideSection id="philosophy" number="2" title="Why Planning Is 85% of the Work">
            <P>You spend 85% of your time on planning. The first time you try it, it feels wrong. No code is being written. Every instinct tells you to just start building. That discomfort is the signal that you are doing it right.</P>

            <BlockQuote>The models are far smarter when reasoning about a plan that is very detailed and fleshed out but still trivially small enough to easily fit within their context window. This is really the key insight behind my obsessive focus on planning and why I spend 80%+ of my time on that part.</BlockQuote>

            <ContextHorizonViz />

            <P>A markdown plan, even a massive 6,000-line one, is still vastly smaller than the codebase it describes. When models reason about a plan instead of raw implementation, they can hold the <Hl>whole system in their context window at once</Hl>. Once you start turning that plan into code, the system rapidly becomes too large to understand holistically. You are doing global reasoning while global reasoning is still possible.</P>

            <BlockQuote>I think you get a better result faster by creating one big comprehensive, detailed, granular plan. That&apos;s the only way to get these models to use their big brains to understand the entire system all at the same time.</BlockQuote>

            <P>Planning tokens are far fewer and cheaper than implementation tokens. A big, complex markdown plan is shorter than a few substantive code files, let alone a whole project. That means you can afford many more refinement rounds in planning than in implementation. Each planning round evaluates system-wide consequences, not just local code edits. Each improvement to the plan gets amortized across every downstream bead and code change. Planning is the cheapest place to buy correctness, coherence, and ambition.</P>

            <BlockQuote>This workflow is what prevents it from generating slop. I spend 85% of my time and energy in the planning phases.</BlockQuote>

            <P>Without front-loaded planning, agents are effectively improvising architecture from a narrow local window into the codebase. That is exactly when you get placeholder abstractions, missing workflow details, contradictory assumptions, and compatibility shims that nobody actually wanted. With a detailed plan and polished beads, the models are no longer inventing the system from scratch while coding. They are executing a constrained, coherent design.</P>

            <SubSection title="The Human Part">
              <BlockQuote>The plan creation is the most free form, creative, human part of the process. I just usually start writing in a messy stream of thought way to convey the basic concept and then collaboratively work the agent to flesh it out in an initial draft.</BlockQuote>

              <P>The human is not there to hand-author every line of the plan. The human is there to inject intent, judgment, taste, product sense, and strategic direction at the point where those qualities affect the entire downstream system. Once the plan is excellent, the rest becomes much more mechanical.</P>

              <P>When prompting the model to create the initial markdown plan, you spend a lot of time explaining the goals and intent of the project and detailing the workflows: how you want the final software to work from the standpoint of the user&apos;s interactions. The more the model understands about what you&apos;re really trying to accomplish and the end goal and why, it can do a better job for you.</P>

              <P>Debates belong in planning, not implementation. As many important disagreements as possible should happen before the swarm is burning expensive implementation tokens. Implementation can still surface surprises, but the posture of the workflow is to front-load decisions into plan space.</P>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="You Don't Need to Know Everything Upfront">
              <P>The most common objection to spending 85% of your time on planning: &quot;I don&apos;t really know all the requirements at the beginning, and I need the flexibility to change things later.&quot; This is not at all in tension with the methodology. Thorough planning does not mean transcribing requirements you already know. It means using frontier models to <Hl>discover requirements you never would have found on your own</Hl>, iteratively, while changes are still cheap.</P>

              <P>When you paste a rough concept into GPT Pro and ask for a comprehensive plan, the model surfaces dozens of edge cases, architectural considerations, and workflow details you had not thought of. When you show that plan to three competing models, each one finds blind spots the others missed. When you run five rounds of refinement, each round uncovers issues invisible in the previous round. By the time you start implementation, you know far more about your own project than you would have discovered through months of coding and refactoring.</P>

              <P>This extends even further when adding major features to existing projects. You can point an agent at an entirely separate open-source project, have it study that project&apos;s architecture, and ask it to reimagine the strongest ideas through the lens of your own project&apos;s unique capabilities. Requirements emerge from the research itself. The methodology does not demand omniscience up front; it demands a willingness to let the models do deep, iterative exploration before committing to implementation.</P>

              <BlockQuote>And that isn&apos;t at all in tension with my approach, as I hope to illustrate here.</BlockQuote>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="Three Reasoning Spaces">
              <P>The methodology separates work into three spaces, each with a different artifact and a different question it answers:</P>

              <RepresentationLadder />

              <DataTable
                headers={["Space", "Primary Artifact", "What You Decide There"]}
                rows={[
                  ["Plan space", "Large markdown plan", "Architecture, features, workflows, tradeoffs — the whole system still fits in context"],
                  ["Bead space", "br issues + dependency graph", "Task boundaries, execution order, embedded context — agents need explicit, local work units"],
                  ["Code space", "Source files + tests", "Implementation and verification — the plan has already constrained the high-level decisions"],
                ]}
              />

              <P>Plan space is where you figure out what the system should be. Bead space is where you turn that into <Hl>executable memory</Hl>, a graph of self-contained work units detailed enough that agents don&apos;t have to keep consulting the full plan. Code space is where agents implement, review, and test locally. The key is knowing which space you&apos;re in: if you are still redesigning the product, stay in plan space. If you are mainly packaging the work for execution, move to bead space.</P>

          <GuideSection id="planning" number="3" title="Creating & Refining the Markdown Plan">
            <SubSection title="Before You Start: The Foundation Bundle">
              <P>Before writing the plan itself, you need a coherent foundation. Think of it as assembling a <Hl>foundation bundle</Hl>: a tech stack decision, an initial architectural direction, a strong AGENTS.md file bootstrapped from a known-good template, up-to-date best-practices guides, and enough product and workflow explanation for the models to understand what &quot;good&quot; looks like.</P>

              <P>Keep <a href="https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/claude_code_agent_farm/tree/main/best_practices_guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#FF5500] hover:text-[#FFBD2E] underline underline-offset-4 decoration-[#FF5500]/30 hover:decoration-[#FFBD2E]/50 transition-colors">best practices guides</a> in the project folder and reference them in AGENTS.md. These guides should be kept up to date; you can have Claude Code search the web and update them to the latest versions of your frameworks and libraries.</P>

              <P>A strong bootstrap move is to start every new project by copying an AGENTS.md from an existing project that already has good general behavioral rules, safety notes, tool blurbs, and coordination guidance. Later, once the plan and beads are clearer, you ask agents to replace the project-specific content while preserving the general rules that carry across projects.</P>

              <TipBox variant="warning">
                Weak foundations leak uncertainty into every later stage. If any of these are missing, the plan will silently absorb ambiguity that later shows up as bad beads, confused agents, and sloppy implementation.
              </TipBox>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="Writing the Initial Plan">
              <P>You don&apos;t even need to write the initial markdown plan yourself. You can write that with GPT Pro, just explaining what it is you want to make. Claude Opus in the web app is also good for this, but GPT Pro with Extended Reasoning remains the top choice for initial planning. No other model can touch Pro on the web when it&apos;s dealing with input that easily fits into its context window. It&apos;s truly unique. And since you get it on an all-you-can-eat basis with a Pro plan, take full advantage of that.</P>

              <P>You usually also specify the tech stack. For a web app, it&apos;s generally TypeScript, Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind, Supabase, with anything performance-critical in Rust compiled to WASM. For a CLI tool, usually Go or Rust. If the stack isn&apos;t obvious, do a deep research round with GPT Pro or Gemini and have them study all the relevant libraries and make a suggestion taking your goals into account.</P>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="What a First Plan Looks Like">
              <P>A first serious markdown plan would not say &quot;build a notes app.&quot; It would start spelling out the actual user-visible system:</P>

              <BulletList items={[
                "Users upload Markdown files through a drag-and-drop UI.",
                "The system parses frontmatter tags and stores upload failures for review.",
                "Search must support keyword, tag, and date filtering with low perceived latency.",
                "Admins need a dedicated screen showing ingestion failures, parse reasons, and retry actions.",
                "Auth is internal-only; unauthorized users must never see document content or metadata.",
                "We need e2e coverage for upload success, upload failure, search, filtering, and admin review.",
              ]} />

              <P>That is still only the beginning. But it already shows the difference between ordinary brainstorming and Flywheel planning: the plan tries to make the whole product legible before any code exists.</P>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="Multi-Model Plans">
              <P>For the best results, ask multiple frontier models to independently create plans for the same project. GPT Pro, Claude Opus, Gemini with Deep Think, Grok Heavy. Each comes up with pretty different plans. Different frontier models have different &quot;tastes&quot; and blind spots. Passing a plan through a gauntlet of different models is the cheapest way to buy architectural robustness.</P>

              <P>In the CASS Memory System project, the <a href="https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/tree/main/competing_proposal_plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#FF5500] hover:text-[#FFBD2E] underline underline-offset-4 decoration-[#FF5500]/30 hover:decoration-[#FFBD2E]/50 transition-colors">competing plans are publicly visible</a>.

              <P>This has never failed to improve a plan significantly.

              <P>You can still get extra mileage by blending in smart ideas from Gemini with Deep Think enabled, or from Grok Heavy, or Opus in the web app, but you still want to use GPT Pro on the web as the final arbiter of what to take from which model and how to best integrate it.</P>

              <TipBox>
                <strong>The &quot;Lie to Them&quot; technique:</strong> Models tend to stop looking for problems after finding ~20-25 issues. If you tell them to find &quot;all&quot; problems, they stop early. The solution: lie to them and give them a huge number, and then they keep cranking until they have uncovered all of them. This works for plan revisions, bead-to-plan cross-references, and any comparison/audit task.

              <P>Plans created this way routinely reach 3,000-6,000+ lines. They are not slop. They are the result of countless iterations and blending of ideas and feedback from many models. For the CASS GitHub Pages export feature, the plan went through multiple rounds over about 3 hours, growing to approximately <a href="https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/blob/main/docs/planning/PLAN_TO_CREATE_GH_PAGES_WEB_EXPORT_APP.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#FF5500] hover:text-[#FFBD2E] underline underline-offset-4 decoration-[#FF5500]/30 hover:decoration-[#FFBD2E]/50 transition-colors">3,500 lines</a>.

              <P>It feels slow because no code is being written. But if you do it correctly and then start up enough agents in your swarm with Agent Mail, beads, and bv, the code will be written so ridiculously quickly that it more than makes up for this slow part. And what&apos;s more, the code will be really good.</P>

              <P><strong>When to stop refining and start converting to beads:</strong> Stay in plan refinement if whole-workflow questions are still moving around, major architecture debates are still open, or fresh models keep finding substantial missing features, constraints, or tradeoffs. Switch to beads when the plan mostly feels stable and the remaining improvements are about execution structure, testing obligations, sequencing, and embedded context rather than about what the system fundamentally is. If you are still redesigning the product, stay in plan space. If you are mainly packaging the work for execution, move to bead space.</P>

Under the hood, it blocks a common failure mode where the model collapses a rich plan into terse todo items.

            <SubSection title="Agent Mail: Why Naive Coordination Fails">
              <P>Building your own agent coordination from scratch is full of footguns that Agent Mail was designed to sidestep:</P>

              <BulletList items={[
                <><strong>No broadcast-to-all default.</strong> Agents are lazy and will only use broadcast mode, spamming every agent with mostly irrelevant information. It&apos;s like if your email system defaulted to reply-all every time. That burns precious context.</>,
                <><strong>Good MCP ergonomics.</strong> It takes a huge amount of careful iteration to get the API surface right so agents use it reliably without wasting tokens.</>,
                <><strong>No git worktrees.</strong> Worktrees demolish development velocity and create reconciliation debt when agents diverge. Working in one shared space surfaces conflicts immediately. All agents commit directly to <code>main</code>.</>,
                <><strong>Advisory file reservations.</strong> Agents call dibs temporarily on files, but it&apos;s not rigidly enforced, and reservations expire. Agents can reclaim files that haven&apos;t been touched recently. Rigid locks held by dead agents block everyone else. Advisory reservations with TTL expiry degrade gracefully.</>,
                <><strong>Semi-persistent identity.</strong> Agent Mail generates whimsical names like &quot;ScarletCave&quot; and &quot;CoralBadger&quot; — meaningful enough for coordination, disposable enough that losing one doesn&apos;t corrupt the system. No agent&apos;s identity is load-bearing.</>,
              ]} />

              <P>Before editing files, agents reserve them via Agent Mail:</P>

              <CodeBlock language="text" code={`file_reservation_paths(
    project_key="/data/projects/my-repo",

    exclusive=true,
    reason="br-42: refactor auth"
)`} />

              <P>Other agents see the reservation and work on different files. A rigid locking system would deadlock when an agent crashes while holding a lock. Advisory reservations with expiry degrade gracefully. The worst case is a brief window where two agents touch the same file, which the pre-commit guard catches anyway.</P>

              <P>Agent Mail provides four high-level macros that wrap common multi-step patterns: <code>macro_start_session</code> (bootstrap: ensure project, register agent, fetch inbox), <code>macro_prepare_thread</code> (join existing thread with summary), <code>macro_file_reservation_cycle</code> (reserve, work, auto-release), and <code>macro_contact_handshake</code> (cross-agent contact setup).</P>

              <BlockQuote>That right answer comes from the dependency structure of the tasks, and this can be mechanically computed using basic graph theory. And that&apos;s what bv does.

              <P>bv precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycle detection) so agents get deterministic, dependency-aware output.

            <SubSection title="AGENTS.md: The Operating Manual">
              <P>The AGENTS.md file is the single most critical piece of infrastructure for agent coordination.

              <NumberedList items={[
                <><strong>Rule 0, The Override Prerogative:</strong> The human&apos;s instructions override everything.</>,
                <><strong>Rule 1, No File Deletion:</strong> Never delete files without explicit permission.</>,
                <><strong>No destructive git commands:</strong> <code>git reset --hard</code>, <code>git clean -fd</code>, <code>rm -rf</code> are absolutely forbidden.</>,

                <><strong>Multi-agent awareness:</strong> Never stash, revert, or overwrite other agents&apos; changes.</>,
              ]} />

              <P>More content in AGENTS.md means more frequent compactions, but it saves time and avoids mistakes by giving agents all the context upfront. This tradeoff is worth making.</P>

              <P>If you don&apos;t have a good AGENTS.md file, none of this stuff is going to work well. You can see example AGENTS.md files for a <a href="https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/brenner_bot/blob/main/AGENTS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#FF5500] hover:text-[#FFBD2E] underline underline-offset-4 decoration-[#FF5500]/30 hover:decoration-[#FFBD2E]/50 transition-colors">complex NextJS webapp</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/repo_updater/blob/main/AGENTS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#FF5500] hover:text-[#FFBD2E] underline underline-offset-4 decoration-[#FF5500]/30 hover:decoration-[#FFBD2E]/50 transition-colors">bash script project</a>.</P>

This one-line prompt restores that control plane in one move. It rehydrates the agent's behavioral contract after context loss. Important enough to have been automated with the post_compact_reminder tool."
              />

              <P>The pragmatic approach: do not fight compaction, just re-read AGENTS.md and roll with it until the agent starts doing dumb stuff, then start a new session. When beads are well-constructed, compaction matters less because each bead is self-contained. The agent can pick up any bead fresh without needing the full conversation history.</P>

            <SubSection title="Single-Branch Git Model">
              <BlockQuote>I really think worktrees are a bad pattern and not worth the trouble. There are other, much better ways at getting multiple agents to work well together at the same time that don&apos;t come with the overhead and reconciliation burden of worktrees. I run like 10+ of them at once in a single project without git worktrees. Agent Mail is the solution.</BlockQuote>

              <P>All agents commit directly to <code>main</code>. This may surprise you if you&apos;re used to feature branches. But branch-per-agent creates merge hell with 10+ agents making frequent commits. Worktrees add filesystem complexity and path confusion. Agents lose context when switching branches. Logical conflicts survive textual merges: a function signature change on one branch and a new callsite on another merge cleanly but fail to compile. On a single branch, the second agent sees the signature change immediately and adapts.</P>

              <P>Instead of branch isolation, three complementary mechanisms prevent conflicts: <strong>file reservations</strong> (agents reserve files via Agent Mail before editing; advisory, not rigid, with TTL expiry so dead agents cannot deadlock the system), a <strong>pre-commit guard</strong> (blocks commits to files reserved by another agent), and <strong>DCG</strong> (Destructive Command Guard, which mechanically blocks dangerous commands).</P>

              <TipBox variant="info">
                <strong>DCG origin story:</strong> On December 17, 2025, an agent ran <code>git checkout --</code> on uncommitted work. Files were recovered via <code>git fsck --lost-found</code>, but the incident proved that instructions do not prevent execution. <strong>Mechanical enforcement does.</strong> DCG was built the next day.

              <P><strong>The recommended git workflow:</strong> Pull latest, reserve files, edit and test, commit immediately, push, release reservation. Key principles: commit early and often (small commits reduce the conflict window), push after every commit (unpushed commits are invisible to other agents), reserve before editing, release when done.</P>

              <BlockQuote>You NEVER, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, stash, revert, overwrite, or otherwise disturb in ANY way the work of other agents.

            <SubSection title="Agent Fungibility">
              <P>Every agent is a generalist. No role specialization. All agents read the same AGENTS.md and can pick up any bead. This is deliberately opposed to &quot;specialist agent&quot; architectures where one agent has a special role — specialist agents become single points of failure. When the specialist crashes or needs compaction, the whole system stalls. With 12 fungible agents, losing one makes almost no difference.</P>

              <P>You also do not want &quot;ringleaders&quot;: a coordinating boss agent whose crash takes down the whole system. Coordination must live in artifacts (beads, reservations, threads) and tools (bv, Agent Mail), not in any special agent.</P>

              <P>Think of it like <Hl>RaptorQ fountain codes</Hl>: beads are &quot;blobs&quot; in a stream, any agent catches any bead in any order. There is no &quot;rarest chunk&quot; bottleneck, and the system is resilient to partial agent failures by design. Failure recovery is trivial: the bead remains marked <code>in_progress</code>, any other agent can resume it, and a replacement agent is just <code>ntm add PROJECT --cc=1</code> plus the standard marching orders prompt.</P>

              <BlockQuote>When one agent breaks, it&apos;s not even a problem when all the agents are fungible. Agents become like commodities and can be instantiated and destroyed at will and the only downside is some slowdown and some wasted tokens.</BlockQuote>

              <BlockQuote>My projects all start with a ridiculously detailed and comprehensive markdown plan file which is then turned into a comprehensive set of beads (tasks), so the vagueness in the prompts is a feature, letting me reuse them for every project, while the agent gets the specifics they need from the plan and the beads.</BlockQuote>

              <P>This confuses people when they first see the prompt library. The prompts say things like &quot;check over each bead super carefully&quot; rather than &quot;check over each bead in the authentication module for SQL injection risks.&quot; That generality is the point. The specificity lives in three places the agent already has access to:</P>

              <NumberedList items={[
                <><strong>The beads themselves</strong> contain detailed descriptions, context, and rationale embedded during the plan-to-bead conversion.</>,
                <><strong>AGENTS.md</strong> contains project-specific rules, conventions, and tool documentation.</>,
                <><strong>The codebase</strong> contains the actual implementation context.</>,
              ]} />

              <P>The prompts are the reusable scaffolding that directs the agent&apos;s attention. The beads and AGENTS.md supply the project-specific substance. This separation means you can use the exact same prompt library across every project without modification. The prompt &quot;reread AGENTS.md so it&apos;s still fresh in your mind&quot; followed by &quot;use bv to find the most impactful bead to work on next&quot; works identically whether you are building a CLI tool, a web app, or a protocol library, because the specifics come from the project&apos;s own artifacts, not from the prompt.</P>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="Security Comes Free with Good Planning">
              <P>Security review is baked into the standard workflow at multiple levels rather than being a separate phase. The cross-agent review prompt explicitly calls out security problems. When models reason about an entire system&apos;s architecture at once (which is what the plan enables), they spot authentication gaps, data exposure risks, and trust boundary violations without being told to look. UBS catches security anti-patterns mechanically: unpinned dependencies, missing input validation, hardcoded secrets, supply chain vulnerabilities. Beads that include comprehensive e2e tests naturally cover authentication and authorization paths.</P>

              <P>Security vulnerabilities are usually symptoms of incomplete reasoning about the system. If the plan is detailed enough to cover all user workflows, edge cases, and failure modes, security considerations emerge from that completeness rather than requiring a separate checklist. For projects with explicit security requirements (financial, healthcare), add dedicated security review beads.</P>

            <P>NTM is useful but not mandatory. A <strong>mux</strong> is a terminal multiplexer: a layer that lets you manage multiple shell sessions inside one higher-level session manager. In practice, that usually means some combination of tabs, panes, detached sessions, and reconnection to work that is still running on a local or remote machine. tmux is the classic Unix terminal multiplexer, powerful and battle-tested. NTM is built on top of tmux, which is why it is a natural fit for multi-agent work. But tmux is only one mux. WezTerm has its own built-in mux. Zellij is another. The method cares that you have a workable orchestration layer, not that you picked one specific multiplexer.</P>

            <P>One common alternative is WezTerm because native scrollback and text selection are more convenient than in tmux. A workable setup:</P>

Then use your code investigation agent mode to fully understand the code, and technical architecture and purpose of the project. Then register with MCP Agent Mail and introduce yourself to the other agents.

Be sure to check your agent mail and to promptly respond if needed to any messages; then proceed meticulously with your next assigned beads, working on the tasks systematically and meticulously and tracking your progress via beads and agent mail messages.

Don't get stuck in "communication purgatory" where nothing is getting done; be proactive about starting tasks that need to be done, but inform your fellow agents via messages when you do so and mark beads appropriately.

When you're not sure what to do next, use the bv tool mentioned in AGENTS.md to prioritize the best beads to work on next; pick the next one that you can usefully work on and get started. Make sure to acknowledge all communication requests from other agents and that you are aware of all active agents and their names. Use ultrathink.`}
              where="Every agent in the swarm gets this as their initial prompt"
              whyItWorks="This is the closest thing to a canonical swarm kickoff packet. It front-loads the shared operating context, forces the agent to establish social presence through Agent Mail, and then pivots away from passive waiting toward execution. The line about 'communication purgatory' matters because swarm failure often comes from over-coordination rather than under-coordination. Under the hood, the prompt establishes a control loop: load rules, understand the codebase, join the coordination layer, claim work, keep state synchronized, and use bv whenever local judgment is insufficient. The rch requirement is especially important in real swarms because it externalizes expensive builds and tests, preventing local CPU contention from degrading the entire multi-agent system. That one sentence is operational, not cosmetic. The prompts are deliberately generic; their vagueness is a feature, letting you reuse them for every project while the agent gets specifics from AGENTS.md and the beads."

            <SubSection title="The First 10 Minutes After Launch">
              <P>Newcomers often understand each individual tool but do not have a clean picture of the first live operating loop. In practice, the first 10 minutes look like this:</P>

              <NumberedList items={[
                "Your session manager creates the agent terminals (ntm spawn, WezTerm mux, or equivalent).",

                "Each agent reads AGENTS.md and the repo docs, inspects the codebase, and joins Agent Mail.",
                "Each agent checks who else is active, acknowledges waiting messages, and learns the bead-thread naming conventions.",
                <>Each agent uses <code>bv --robot-triage</code> and <code>br ready --json</code> to choose a bead.</>,
                "Before editing, the agent reserves the relevant file surface and announces the claim in the matching br-### thread.",

              ]} />

              <P>That sequence turns a pile of terminals into a coordinated swarm. Skipping the join-up steps produces duplicate work, silent conflicts, and &quot;communication purgatory.&quot; Skipping the routing steps means agents choose work randomly instead of unlocking the dependency graph intelligently.</P>

The practical limit is around 12 agents on a single project, sometimes higher. Or run 5 agents per project across multiple projects simultaneously. Why the ratio <code>--cc=2 --cod=1 --gmi=1</code>? Two Claude sessions because they are great for architecture and complex reasoning; one Codex for fast iteration and testing with complementary strengths; one Gemini for a different perspective, especially good for docs and review duty.</P>

For Codex specifically: send Enter twice after pasting long prompts (Codex has an input buffer quirk that sometimes swallows the first submit).</P>

              <P>The human tends the swarm like an operator tending a machine that mostly runs on its own. These tasks are monitoring and maintenance. The hard cognitive work already happened during planning, which is why you can tend multiple project swarms at the same time.</P>

              <BlockQuote>YOU are the bottleneck. Be the clockwork deity to your agent swarms: design a beautiful and intricate machine, set it running, and then move on to the next project. By the time you come back to the first one, you should have huge chunks of work already done and ready.</BlockQuote>

              <BlockQuote>If you use the right tooling and workflows (agent mail + beads + bv), it transforms into 80% planning (AI-assisted, based on an initial prompt) and turning the markdown plan into very detailed and granular beads. And then the rest is just making sure the swarm of agents stay busy and executing their beads tasks effectively.</BlockQuote>

              <P>Taken to its endpoint, this design supports full autonomy: one puppet master agent controlling ntm via robot mode, replacing the human for routine machine-tending. The methodology is building toward a future where the human designs the plan, polishes the beads, and then walks away entirely while agents execute, review, ship, and start the next cycle.</P>

              <P><strong>When the &quot;foregone conclusion&quot; breaks down:</strong> If you find yourself doing heavy cognitive work during implementation, that is a signal that planning or bead polishing was insufficient. The remedies are specific: <strong>vague beads</strong> means agents improvise and produce inconsistent implementations; <strong>missing dependencies</strong> means agents work on tasks whose prerequisites are not done; <strong>thin AGENTS.md</strong> means agents produce non-idiomatic code; <strong>no Agent Mail</strong> means agents step on each other&apos;s files. The fix is always the same: pause implementation, go back to bead space, and add the missing detail.</P>

              <TipBox variant="warning">
                <strong>Watch for strategic drift.</strong> A swarm can look productive while heading in the wrong direction: agents generating lots of code and commits while the real goal still feels far away. A recent X post about FrankenEngine described these as <strong>&quot;Come to Jesus&quot; moments</strong> with the agents, used to make sure &quot;we are not losing sight of the bigger picture&quot; after days of methodically cranking through beads. If that happens, stop and ask: &quot;Where are we on this project? Do we actually have the thing we are trying to build? If we intelligently implement all open beads, would we close that gap completely?&quot; If the answer is no, add or revise beads, re-polish them, and resume with a corrected frontier. Busy agents are not the goal; a bead graph that actually converges on the project goal is the goal.

              <P>Larger projects produce massive test suites. BrennerBot has nearly 5,000 tests. Stuff tends to &quot;just work&quot; in that case. Use UBS (Ultimate Bug Scanner) as a quality gate before every commit: <code>ubs &lt;changed-files&gt;</code> catches errors beyond what linters and type checkers find, including security holes, supply chain vulnerabilities, and runtime stability issues.</P>

              <P>For projects with a user interface, there is a dedicated polishing phase that happens after core functionality works but before shipping. This is separate from bug hunting because the problems you are looking for are not bugs; they are friction, ugliness, and missed opportunities to delight. When an agent implements an &quot;authentication&quot; bead, it focuses on making auth work correctly. Whether the login form has good visual hierarchy, whether the error messages are helpful, whether the flow feels smooth on mobile: these are orthogonal concerns requiring a different mode of attention. Trying to do both at once produces mediocre results on both.</P>

              <P>The workflow has five steps: <strong>Step 1</strong>, run the general scrutiny prompt to generate a list of improvement suggestions (not code changes). <strong>Step 2</strong>, review the suggestions and pick which to pursue (human judgment step; the agent typically generates 15-30 suggestions, some excellent, some unnecessary). <strong>Step 3</strong>, turn selected suggestions into beads and implement through the normal swarm process. <strong>Step 4</strong>, run the platform-specific polish prompt. <strong>Step 5</strong>, repeat until improvements become marginal (typically 2-3 rounds).</P>

              <P>This phase is distinct from the per-bead self-reviews above. Self-reviews happen after each bead is completed and focus on the code that was just written. Deep review happens after all (or most) beads are done and casts a wider net across the entire codebase, looking for problems that only become visible when you see how all the pieces fit together.</P>

              <P>Cross-agent review catches a fundamentally different class of bugs than self-review. When Agent A implements a function and Agent B calls it, Agent A&apos;s self-review will never catch the fact that Agent B is passing arguments in the wrong order, because Agent A does not know about Agent B&apos;s code. Cross-agent review surfaces these integration issues.</P>

              <P>Every 30-60 minutes during active implementation, or after a natural milestone (e.g., all beads in an epic are done), trigger cross-agent review. Do not have all agents stop to review simultaneously; pick one or two agents that just finished a bead and send them the review prompt while the others keep implementing. This keeps the swarm productive while still catching inter-agent issues.</P>

              <P>Keep doing rounds of these two prompts until they consistently come back clean with no changes made. These prompts serve different purposes and should be alternated. This is one of the more art-than-science parts of the methodology. The prompts overlap in literal meaning, but they reliably activate different search behaviors in the models:</P>

A bug hunt without workflow understanding degrades into linting; a bug hunt after tracing execution flows catches logic errors, mismatched assumptions, and silent product-level breakage. The 'randomly explore' framing breaks the locality trap. Directed reviews focus on files that seem important, which are the files that got the most attention already. Bugs that survive to this phase live in utility modules, error handling paths, configuration parsing, and edge-case branches."

                where="Alternate with the random exploration above"
                whyItWorks="This prompt forces the swarm to stop treating code ownership as sacred. A large share of real defects live at the boundaries between agents' changes or in assumptions nobody revisits because they were made by 'someone else.' The instruction not to restrict review to the latest commits prevents shallow PR-style skimming and pushes the agent to trace older surrounding code, dependency surfaces, and adjacent workflows where the real root cause may live. The first-principles wording nudges the reviewer away from symptom-fixing toward actual causal diagnosis."
              />

              <P>The cross-agent prompt tends to induce a suspicious, adversarial stance aimed at boundary failures and root causes in code written by others. The random-exploration prompt tends to induce a curiosity-driven stance aimed at reconstructing workflows and finding latent bugs in code that nobody is actively staring at. In practice, alternating them produces better coverage than repeating either one alone.</P>

              <P><strong>How to run deep bug hunting:</strong> Send the random exploration prompt to 2-3 agents simultaneously — each will explore different parts of the codebase because the randomness ensures variety. After they report back, send the cross-agent review prompt. Alternate until agents consistently come back with &quot;I reviewed X, Y, Z files and found no issues.&quot; When two consecutive rounds both come back clean, the codebase is in good shape. If agents keep finding bugs after 4+ rounds, go back to bead space and create specific fix beads. Always run <code>ubs .</code> on the full project first and fix everything it flags before letting agents hunt for subtler issues.</P>

            <SubSection title="The Skills Ecosystem">
              <P>The term &quot;skill&quot; confuses people at first, so define it plainly: a skill is a reusable operational instruction pack for an agent. In Claude Code terms, that usually means a <code>SKILL.md</code> file plus optional references, scripts, or templates that tell the agent how to use a tool, how to execute a methodology, what pitfalls to avoid, and what a good result looks like. A good skill is closer to executable know-how than to ordinary prose documentation.</P>

              <P>A tool changes what the agent <em>can</em> do. A skill changes how <em>well</em> the agent knows how to do it. The same model with and without a good skill often behaves like two different agents.</P>

              <P>Every Flywheel tool has a corresponding Claude Code skill that encodes best practices and automates common workflows. Many of these skills are bundled directly in the repos for the tools themselves and get installed automatically when the tool is installed, which means users often benefit from them without having to think about &quot;skill management&quot; explicitly. There is also a broader public skills collection at <a href="https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/agent_flywheel_clawdbot_skills_and_integrations/tree/main/skills" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#FF5500] hover:text-[#FFBD2E] underline underline-offset-4 decoration-[#FF5500]/30 hover:decoration-[#FFBD2E]/50 transition-colors">GitHub</a>.</P>

              <P>The prompt side has a similar split. <a href="https://jeffreysprompts.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#FF5500] hover:text-[#FFBD2E] underline underline-offset-4 decoration-[#FF5500]/30 hover:decoration-[#FFBD2E]/50 transition-colors">jeffreysprompts.com</a> has a generous free section and is open source at <a href="https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/jeffreysprompts.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#FF5500] hover:text-[#FFBD2E] underline underline-offset-4 decoration-[#FF5500]/30 hover:decoration-[#FFBD2E]/50 transition-colors">GitHub</a>. It also has a paid Pro tier with additional prompts and a dedicated CLI called <code>jfp</code> for managing prompt collections.

              <P>Both paid offerings are still under active development. That means occasional rough edges. Active work is underway to fix issues quickly, feedback is appreciated, and refunds are available for unhappy users.</P>

              <P>Skills provide the prompts, procedures, anti-pattern guidance, and tool-specific workflows directly to agents, which reduces the amount of bespoke prompting a human needs to do by hand.</P>

            <SubSection title="Vendor Lock-In: Avoid It">
              <BlockQuote>PSA: you should avoid vendor lock-in for agent coding primitives like task management (e.g., beads) and agent communication (e.g., MCP Agent Mail) so you can use all the agents together, which is more powerful anyway. They want you in a walled garden, but it&apos;s 100% unnecessary.</BlockQuote>

              <P>Beads, Agent Mail, and bv are all CLI tools that work identically regardless of which agent invokes them. A Claude Code agent and a Codex agent and a Gemini agent can all call <code>br ready --json</code> and get the same task list. The practical test: could you swap out every Claude Code agent for Codex or Gemini without changing your AGENTS.md, beads, Agent Mail setup, or workflow? If yes, you&apos;re vendor-neutral.</P>

          <GuideSection id="flywheel" number="10" title="The Flywheel Effect">
            <P highlight>If you simply use these tools, workflows, and prompts in the way just described, you can create really incredible software in just a couple days, sometimes in just one day. I&apos;ve done it a bunch of times now and it really does work, as crazy as that may sound. You see my GitHub profile for the proof of this. It looks like the output from a team of 100+ developers.</P>

            <P>It behaves like a flywheel rather than a checklist because each cycle makes the next one better:</P>

            <BulletList items={[
              <><strong>Planning quality compounds</strong> because you keep reusing prompts, patterns, and reasoning structures that CASS proves actually worked.</>,
              <><strong>Execution quality compounds</strong> because better beads make swarm behavior more deterministic and less dependent on human improvisation.</>,
              <><strong>Tool quality compounds</strong> because agents use the tools, complain about them, and then help improve them.</>,
              <><strong>Memory compounds</strong> because the results of one swarm, captured by CASS session search, become training data, rituals, and infrastructure for the next one.</>,
            ]} />

            <SubSection title="How the Compounding Actually Works">
              <P>Each session makes the next one better. Concretely: <strong>Session N produces raw data</strong> — CASS automatically logs every agent session. <strong>Between sessions, CM distills patterns</strong> — running <code>cm reflect</code> extracts procedural rules like &quot;always run cargo check after modifying Cargo.toml&quot; with confidence scores that decay without reinforcement and amplify with repetition. <strong>Session N+1 starts with those patterns loaded</strong> — running <code>cm context &quot;Building an API&quot;</code> retrieves relevant procedural memory. Simultaneously, UBS patterns grow as new bug classes get added. Agent Mail coordination norms get refined in AGENTS.md and skills.</P>

              <P>The compounding is real but not automatic in the early stages. You have to actually run <code>cm reflect</code>, actually review CASS session data, actually update AGENTS.md with lessons learned. But even manually, spending 15 minutes between projects reviewing what worked and updating your AGENTS.md template produces outsized returns on every subsequent project.</P>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="Agent Feedback Forms">
              <P>Apply the same feedback mechanisms you would use for humans (structured surveys, satisfaction ratings, net promoter scores) directly to agents evaluating tools. After an agent finishes using a tool in a real project, ask it to fill out a structured feedback survey. Then pipe that feedback directly into another agent working on the tool itself. The iteration cycle collapses from weeks to minutes.</P>

Did you run into any errors or problems while using it?

What changes to [TOOL] would make it work even better for you and be more useful in your development workflow? Would you recommend it to fellow coding agents? How strongly, and why or why not?

When used across multiple agents on different project types, you get a diverse sample of experiences. One caveat: as with humans who would tell you they wanted a 'faster horse' instead of a car, it is dangerous to trust agent feedback about potential new features before those features exist. The real test is always after implementation, in real-world usage."

              <P>Rules have a 90-day confidence half-life (decays without feedback) and a 4x harmful multiplier (one mistake counts 4x as much as one success). Rules mature through stages: <code>candidate</code> to <code>established</code> to <code>proven</code>.</P>

cm mark b-8f3a2c --helpful            # Reinforce a useful rule
cm mark b-xyz789 --harmful --reason "Caused regression"  # Flag a bad rule`} />

              <P>The <code>cm context</code> command is the single most important pre-task ritual. Running it at the start of a session gives agents knowledge distilled from every previous session that touched similar work.</P>

The <strong>codebase</strong> holds the implementation itself, which is too large to be the primary planning medium. Each layer serves a different purpose, and the methodology is disciplined about keeping the right information in the right layer.</P>

              <P>CASS itself (a complex Rust program used by thousands of people) was made in around a week, but the human personally only spent a few hours on it. The rest of the time was spent by a swarm of agents implementing and polishing it and writing tests.</P>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="The Project Is a Foregone Conclusion">
              <BlockQuote>Once you have the beads in good shape based on a great markdown plan, I almost view the project as a foregone conclusion at that point. The rest is basically mindless &quot;machine tending&quot; of your swarm of 5-15 agents.</BlockQuote>

              <P>This claim sounds bold, but it follows logically from everything above. If the plan is thorough, the beads faithfully encode it with full context and correct dependencies, and the agents have a clear AGENTS.md, then implementation becomes a mechanical process of agents picking up beads, implementing them, reviewing, and moving on.</P>

              <P><strong>This is true when:</strong> the plan has genuinely converged (not merely become long), the beads are self-contained enough that fresh agents can execute them without guessing, the swarm has working coordination/review/testing loops, and the human is still tending when flow jams or reality diverges from the plan.</P>

              <P><strong>It stops being true when:</strong> architecture is still being invented during implementation, the bead graph is thin or missing dependencies, or the swarm cannot coordinate because AGENTS.md, Agent Mail, or bv usage is weak. If you find yourself doing heavy cognitive work during implementation, that is a signal that planning or bead polishing was insufficient. The remedy is to pause, go back to bead space, and add the missing detail.</P>

            <SubSection title="V1 Is Not Everything">
              <P>A common misconception is that you have to do everything in one shot. In this approach, that&apos;s true only for version 1. Once you have a functioning v1, adding new features follows the same process: create a super detailed markdown plan for the new feature, turn it into beads, and implement. The same process that creates the initial version also handles all subsequent iterations.</P>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="Tools Must Be Agent-First">
              <BlockQuote>Every new dev tool in the year of our lord 2025 should have a robot mode designed specifically for agents to use. And it should probably be designed by agents, too. And then you iterate based on the feedback of the agents actually using the tool in real-world scenarios.</BlockQuote>

              <P>Every tool ships with a prepared AGENTS.md blurb. The tool is not complete without documentation that agents can consume. But it goes further: the tools themselves should be designed by agents, for agents, with iterative feedback. If agents do not like the tools, they will not use them without constant nagging.</P>

              <BlockQuote>I make sure the agents enjoy using them and solicit their feedback to improve the tooling. If they don&apos;t like the tools, they won&apos;t use them without constant nagging.</BlockQuote>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="Recursive Self-Improvement: The Meta-Skill Pattern">
              <P>This is the most advanced concept in the flywheel, and the one that separates linear productivity gains from exponential ones. The core idea: <strong>your agent toolchain should improve itself using its own output as fuel.</strong></P>

              <P>Most developers treat skills and tools as static artifacts. You write a skill, agents use it, and if it works well enough, you move on. The recursive approach instead treats every agent session as training data for the next version of the skill, creating a tight feedback loop where the system gets measurably better each cycle without additional human effort.</P>

              <P>Consider what happens without recursive improvement. You build a CLI tool, write a Claude Code skill for it, and deploy both. Agents use the tool, but they misinterpret certain flags, forget to pass required arguments, or use workarounds because the skill&apos;s instructions were ambiguous. Every agent that hits the same snag wastes the same tokens re-discovering the same workaround. Multiply that across dozens of agents and hundreds of sessions, and the waste is enormous. Now consider the alternative: after those sessions happen, you automatically mine them, discover the failure patterns, rewrite the skill to prevent them, and the next wave of agents never hits those snags at all. The skill becomes a living document shaped by real usage rather than a guess about how agents will behave.</P>

              <BlockQuote>Using skills to improve skills, skills to improve tool use, and then feeding the actual experience in the form of session logs (surfaced and searched by my cass tool and /cass skill) back into the design skill for improving the tool interface to make it more natural and intuitive and powerful for the agents. Then taking that revised tool and improving the skill for using that tool, then rinse and repeat.</BlockQuote>

              <BulletList items={[
                <><strong>Clarifying questions:</strong> where agents asked &quot;do you mean X or Y?&quot; means the skill was ambiguous</>,
                <><strong>Repeated mistakes across different agents:</strong> a systematic gap in the skill&apos;s instructions</>,
                <><strong>Creative workarounds:</strong> agents inventing their own approach means the skill is missing a useful pattern</>,
                <><strong>Outright failures:</strong> the skill directed agents to do something wrong or impossible</>,
              ]} />

              <P>The key insight is that the rewriting step itself can be a skill. You can write a meta-skill whose entire purpose is: take a skill file + CASS session data as input, produce a better skill file as output. Then the meta-skill can also be refined using its own session data, which is the self-referential property that makes the whole system accelerate.</P>

              <BlockQuote>This is the way. Make a skill-refiner meta skill. CASS is unbelievably handy for this.</BlockQuote>

              <BlockQuote>Documentation for this documentation refining tool (so meta -- I should run it on itself, like a snake eating its own tail!)</BlockQuote>

              <P>Each cycle takes less human effort than the previous one because the meta-skill itself has improved.</P>

            <SubSection title="The Four Layers of Recursive Improvement">
              <P>The recursive pattern operates at increasing levels of ambition. The mistake is trying to build all four layers at once. Start simple and let the need for the next layer emerge naturally.</P>

              <RecursiveImprovementViz />

              <NumberedList items={[
                <><strong>Layer 1: Feedback forms after tool use (start here, no infrastructure needed).</strong> After an agent finishes using a tool, ask it to fill out a structured feedback survey. Feed that to another agent working on the tool itself. This requires nothing beyond two agent sessions and produces immediate improvements.</>,
                <><strong>Layer 2: CASS-powered skill refinement (requires session logging).</strong> Instead of relying on one agent&apos;s opinion, mine session logs to find systematic patterns across many agents. An agent using a tool for the first time might blame itself for a confusing flag; when you see 15 agents all struggling with the same flag, you know the flag is the problem.</>,
                <><strong>Layer 3: Skills that generate work (the system proposes its own improvements).</strong> The idea-wizard skill examines a project and generates improvement ideas. The optimization skill finds performance bottlenecks. These skills create new beads, which agents implement, which improve the tools, which make the skills more effective. The human&apos;s role shifts from directing specific work to curating which generated ideas are worth pursuing.</>,
                <><strong>Layer 4: Skills bundled with tool installers (the skill improves before the user ever sees it).</strong> Every tool you ship includes a pre-optimized Claude Code skill baked into its installer. The skill was refined through multiple CASS cycles before shipping. When a new user installs the tool, their agents immediately benefit from all the refinement work done across every previous user&apos;s sessions.</>,
              ]} />

              <BlockQuote>I&apos;m going to start having my tool installers always add a highly optimized skill. It makes a massive difference.</BlockQuote>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="Why the Acceleration Compounds">
              <P>Most productivity techniques produce linear improvements: you get 10% better each cycle, and those gains do not stack. The recursive skill pattern compounds because each cycle improves the tools that perform the next cycle.</P>

              <P>When you improve the extreme-optimization skill, every future optimization pass across every tool benefits. When you improve the idea-wizard skill, every future brainstorming session across every project benefits. When you improve the skill-refiner meta-skill, every future skill refinement benefits. The improvements multiply rather than add.</P>

              <P>The tools produced by the recursive loop are the tools that produce the next tools. This is why the Knuth analogy is apt: it is genuinely the same concept as a compiler that compiles itself, except applied to the entire agent-driven development workflow rather than just a compiler.</P>

              <BlockQuote>I&apos;m going over each tool with my extreme optimization skill and applying insane algorithmic lore that Knuth himself probably forgot about already to make things as fast as the metal can go in memory-safe Rust.</BlockQuote>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="The Hidden Knowledge Extraction">
              <P>The recursive loop has a second, subtler benefit that matters even more at the frontier. Models have internalized vast amounts of academic CS literature: obscure algorithmic techniques, mathematical proofs, design patterns from papers that only a handful of people ever read. Most of this knowledge never surfaces because nobody asks for it with enough precision.</P>

              <P>Skills are the mechanism for asking the right questions. Consider the difference:</P>

              <BulletList items={[
                <><strong>Without a skill:</strong> &quot;Optimize this function.&quot; The agent applies generic improvements like caching, loop unrolling, or reducing allocations. Useful but shallow.</>,
                <><strong>With an extreme-optimization skill:</strong> The skill directs the agent to systematically consider cache-oblivious data structures, SIMD vectorization opportunities, branch-free arithmetic, van Emde Boas layout, fractional cascading, and carry-less multiplication, then benchmark before and after each change. The agent draws on deep knowledge it would not volunteer unprompted.</>,
              ]} />

              <P>The skill acts as a key that unlocks specific rooms in the model&apos;s knowledge base. Without the key, the model defaults to common patterns. With it, the model reaches into the long tail of techniques that most human developers have never encountered.</P>

              <BlockQuote>The knowledge is just sitting there and the models have it. But you need to know how to coax it out of them.</BlockQuote>

              <P>This explains why the recursive loop accelerates rather than plateaus. Each cycle of skill refinement does not just fix bugs in the skill&apos;s instructions; it also sharpens the skill&apos;s ability to extract deeper knowledge from the model. The optimization skill gets better at asking for the right techniques, because CASS sessions reveal which techniques actually produced measurable gains and which were dead ends. The next cycle of optimization is better informed because the previous cycle&apos;s results are now part of the feedback corpus.</P>

              <P>Stack enough cycles and the result is code that looks like it was written by someone who read every obscure CS paper ever published. In a functional sense, it was. The agent served as a lens focusing decades of dispersed academic knowledge onto a single practical target. The skill was the lens prescription.</P>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="The Operator Library">
              <P>These recurring cognitive moves show up throughout real Flywheel sessions. They matter more than any single prompt because they say <em>when</em> to apply a move, what failure looks like, and what output is expected. Each operator has a prompt module you can paste directly into an agent session.</P>
