**Core sync:** Clone missing repos, pull updates, detect conflicts. Parallel work-stealing queue with
portable locking. Resume interrupted syncs from checkpoint. Actionable resolution commands for every
conflict type (dirty tree, diverged branches, auth failures).

**AI-Assisted Review (ru review):**
- GraphQL batch queries discover issues/PRs across all repos
- Multi-factor priority scoring: type (+20 PRs), labels (+50 security), age, staleness
- Git worktree isolation for parallel sessions (main directory untouched)
- Session drivers: auto, ntm (robot mode API), local (raw tmux)
- Two-phase workflow: --plan (discover) → --apply --push (execute)
- Quality gates: ShellCheck, tests, lint before push

**Agent Sweep (ru agent-sweep):**
- Three-phase AI workflow: understand → plan → execute
- Parallel execution with phase timeouts
- Secret scanning (none/warn/block modes)

**Dependency Updates (ru dep-update):**
- Supported: npm, pip, cargo, go, composer
- Per-dependency test verification with auto-fix attempts
- Major version filtering, regex include/exclude patterns

**Automation & Scripting:**
- Output modes: text, TOON, JSON for CI integration
- Meaningful exit codes: 0=ok, 1=partial, 2=conflicts, 3=system, 4=bad args, 5=interrupted
- Bulk import from GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket/Gitea (ru import)
- Orphan repo cleanup with ru prune`,

**Persistence:** Dual storage - SQLite for fast queries, Git for audit trails. Neither is privileged;
they serve different needs. Database corrupts? Rebuild from Git. Git unavailable? SQLite still works.

**Search:** Hybrid BM25 + hash embeddings (deterministic, no external models) fused with RRF.
Same text = same vector on any machine. Combines keyword precision with semantic recall.

**Suggestions:** UCB bandit optimization that learns from feedback. Each signal (BM25, semantic,
recency, feedback) is an arm with beta distributions. Context modifiers adjust for project type.
Over time, the system learns which signals matter for your workflow.

**Security:** Multi-layer defense:
- ACIP: Classifies content by trust boundary, quarantines prompt injections
- DCG: Command safety tiers (Safe/Caution/Danger/Critical) with approval gates
- Path Policy: Prevents symlink escapes and directory traversal
- Secret Scanner: Redacts credentials and API keys

**Graph Analysis:** Converts skills to JSONL and delegates to bv for PageRank, betweenness,
cycles, critical path analysis, HITS algorithm. Use the right tool for each job.

**MCP Server:** Exposes 12 tools (search, load, evidence, list, show, doctor, lint, suggest,
feedback, index, validate, config) so Claude, Codex, and other MCP-aware agents can use ms
as a native tool, not string-parsing.`,

observes WezTerm panes with sub-50ms latency, capturing output deltas and detecting state
transitions in AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini).

The pattern detection engine recognizes agent-specific states: ready for input, thinking,
rate limited, awaiting approval, idle timeout. When states change, WA can trigger automated
responses via callbacks or Robot Mode.

Robot Mode provides a JSON API for external orchestration:
- wa robot state: Get current state of all observed panes
- wa robot get-text: Extract screen content from specific panes
- wa robot send: Inject keystrokes with configurable delays
- wa robot wait-for: Block until a pattern matches
- wa robot search: Query the FTS5-indexed capture history

The policy engine allows capability gates (e.g., "agent X can only send to its own pane")
to prevent runaway automation. All captured content is stored in SQLite with FTS5 for
full-text search across sessions - invaluable for debugging agent behavior.`,

Built around Sydney Brenner's methodology (Nobel laureate, discoverer of mRNA), it provides a curated corpus (236 transcript
sections with §n anchors), multi-model syntheses (Opus, GPT, Gemini), and full artifact lifecycle management.

**Research Artifact Lifecycle:**
- Hypothesis management: proposed → active → under_attack → killed/validated/dormant
- Discriminative tests: designed → pending → completed/blocked (exclusion beats accumulation)
- Anomaly tracking: active → resolved/deferred/paradigm_shifting (can spawn new hypotheses)
- Critique system: adversarial attacks with severity levels and response tracking
- Evidence packs: import papers, datasets, prior sessions with stable EV-NNN citations

**Cockpit Runtime:**
- Multi-agent sessions via ntm with role-specific prompts (hypothesis_generator, test_designer, adversarial_critic)
- Thread ID is global join key: ties Agent Mail, ntm sessions, artifacts, beads
- Session state machine with phase detection (awaiting_responses → partially_complete → awaiting_compilation)
- Artifact compiler with 50+ validation rules: third alternative checks, potency controls, citation anchors

**The Brenner Approach:**
- Two axioms: Reality has a generative grammar, Understanding = Reconstruction
- "Exclusion is always a tremendously good thing" - design for sharp discriminative experiments
- Third alternative check: "Both could be wrong" - always consider misspecification`,

a system reminder to re-read the project's AGENTS.md file.

Zero runtime overhead — it only activates on compaction events. Configurable reminder
text lets you customize what gets injected. The hook script lives at
~/.local/bin/claude-post-compact-reminder and is registered in Claude Code settings.

This is a hook, not an interactive CLI. Verify installation by checking both the hook
script and the Claude settings entry.`,
