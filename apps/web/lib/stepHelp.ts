          "Choose the operating system on the computer you'll be typing commands on. If you're on a Mac laptop, pick Mac. If you're on a Windows desktop, pick Windows.",
      },
    ],
    tips: [
      "This just affects which terminal instructions you see — you can change it later.",
      "Linux users skip the terminal installation step automatically.",

    commonIssues: [
      {
        symptom: "I already have a terminal, do I need another one?",
        solution:
          "If you're on Mac, the built-in Terminal.app works fine. On Windows, we recommend Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store for a better experience.",
      },
      {
        symptom: "Windows Terminal won't install from the Store",
        solution:
          "Try downloading it directly from GitHub: search 'Windows Terminal GitHub releases' and grab the latest .msixbundle file.",
      },

    tips: [
      "Any terminal that supports SSH will work — the suggested ones just have the best experience.",

    commonIssues: [
      {
        symptom: "ssh-keygen: command not found",
        solution:
          "On Windows, make sure you're using PowerShell or Windows Terminal (not Command Prompt). On Mac/Linux, open a new terminal window.",
      },
      {
        symptom: "option requires an argument -- N (Windows)",
        solution:
          "Older PowerShell versions drop the empty \"\" after -N before ssh-keygen sees it (and ssh-keygen may then sit waiting for a passphrase — press Ctrl+C first). Copy the exact command from this page instead of typing it; it selects the right empty-passphrase argument for your PowerShell version automatically.",
      },
      {
        symptom: "The key file already exists",
        solution:
          "If you already have an SSH key at ~/.ssh/acfs_ed25519, you can skip this step and reuse it. Just make sure you remember the passphrase (if any).",
      },
      {
        symptom: "Permission denied when creating the key",
        solution:
          "Make sure the ~/.ssh directory exists: run 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh' then try again.",
      },
    ],
    tips: [
      "Ed25519 keys are shorter and more secure than RSA keys.",
      "The passphrase is optional but recommended for security.",

  4: {
    commonIssues: [
      {
        symptom: "Which VPS plan should I pick?",
        solution:
          "Use the plan calculator on this step. For most people, start with a 64GB RAM / 16 vCPU Contabo or OVH plan; use 48GB only for smaller swarms, and choose a larger host or multiple hosts for 25+ heavy agents.",
      },
      {
        symptom: "The calculator says my target is undersized",
        solution:
          "Lower the agent count, choose a lighter workload, rent a larger server, or split agents across multiple VPS hosts. Avoid launching a large heavy swarm on a 48GB or 64GB single host.",
      },
    ],
    tips: [
      "Prices are approximate; RAM, vCPU, storage, and region availability matter more than a specific monthly number.",
      "The provider cards below link to the Contabo and OVH signup guidance already used by the wizard.",
    ],
  },

  5: {
    commonIssues: [
      {
        symptom: "I entered my IP but can't continue",
        solution:
          "Make sure you're entering the IPv4 address (looks like 123.45.67.89), not a hostname. Check your VPS provider's dashboard for the IP.",
      },
      {
        symptom: "My VPS shows 'initializing' or 'building'",
        solution:
          "Wait 1-2 minutes for the VPS to finish provisioning. Refresh your provider's dashboard to check the status.",

    ],
    tips: [
      "Copy the IP address directly from your provider's dashboard to avoid typos.",
      "Make sure you selected Ubuntu 24.04 or newer, not Debian, when creating the VPS.",
    ],
  },

  6: {
    commonIssues: [
      {
        symptom: "Connection refused",
        solution:
          "The VPS might still be starting up. Wait 30 seconds and try again. Also verify the IP address is correct.",
      },
      {
        symptom: "Connection timed out",
        solution:
          "Check that your IP address is correct. If using a firewall or VPN, try disabling it temporarily. Your provider may need a few minutes to provision the server.",
      },
      {
        symptom: "Permission denied (publickey)",
        solution:
          "This first connection step expects password login, so the SSH command should not include -i yet. Try ssh root@YOUR_IP. If the server still says publickey and never asks for a password, use your provider console or recreate the VPS with root password login enabled. If only root login is disabled, try ssh ubuntu@YOUR_IP, run sudo -i, and continue only after the prompt ends with #. A sudo password prompt wants the ubuntu Linux account password, not a provider website password or a different root password.",
      },
      {
        symptom: "Host key verification failed",
        solution:
          "If you recreated your VPS, the old key is cached. Run: ssh-keygen -R YOUR_IP  then try connecting again.",
      },
    ],
    tips: [
      "The first connection will ask you to verify the host fingerprint — type 'yes' to continue.",
      "If using Windows, make sure you're in PowerShell, not Command Prompt.",
    ],
  },

  8: {
    commonIssues: [
      {
        symptom: "'bash' is not recognized (Windows)",
        solution:
          "You're running commands on your local machine instead of the VPS. Make sure you SSH into your VPS first, then run the preflight commands.",
      },
      {
        symptom: "APT is locked by another process",
        solution:
          "Another update is running. Wait a few minutes, check the holder with 'sudo fuser -v /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend || true', then reboot and retry if it remains stuck.",
      },
      {
        symptom: "Cannot reach github.com",
        solution:
          "Check your VPS network: try 'ping 8.8.8.8'. If that works but github.com doesn't, inspect DNS with 'resolvectl status' or reboot the VPS before retrying.",
      },
    ],
    tips: [
      "Run all preflight commands on the VPS (your SSH session), not your local machine.",

  9: {
    commonIssues: [
      {
        symptom: "Installation appears stuck or frozen",
        solution:
          "Tool compilation (especially Rust tools) can take 5-15 minutes. The installer shows progress — watch for the spinner. Don't close the terminal.",
      },
      {
        symptom: "SSH connection dropped during install",
        solution:
          "Reconnect via SSH and re-run the installer. It's safe to run multiple times — it skips already-installed components.",
      },
      {
        symptom: "Permission denied errors during install",
        solution:
          "Make sure you're running from a root shell (your prompt should show root@ and end with #). If you connected as ubuntu, run: sudo -i. If sudo asks for a password, use the ubuntu Linux account password, not the VPS root password or provider website password. If you only have the VPS root password, use root SSH or the provider console instead. Re-run the installer only after the prompt ends with #.",
      },
    ],
    tips: [
      "The installer is safe to run multiple times — it won't break anything.",
      "Keep your SSH session open until you see the completion message.",
    ],
  },

  10: {
    commonIssues: [
      {
        symptom: "I can't connect as the SSH user",
        solution:
          "Use the key-based SSH command shown on this step. The default is: ssh -i ~/.ssh/acfs_ed25519 ubuntu@YOUR_IP; replace ubuntu if you chose a different target user. If that fails with 'permission denied', connect as root and check that the installer completed successfully.",

        symptom: "Command not found: acfs",
        solution:
          "Run: source ~/.zshrc  — the acfs command is loaded from your shell configuration. If that doesn't work, the installer may not have completed.",
      },
    ],
    tips: [
      "Run 'source ~/.zshrc' if commands aren't found after installation.",
      "The status check verifies all installed tools — failures here mean the installer needs to be re-run.",
